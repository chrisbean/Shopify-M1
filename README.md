1. **Lander page** with cards linking to first two lessons in module 1.

2. **Lesson 1** ready for review; still needs outro.

3. **Lesson 2** is a placeholder and only contains section headers.

Note that I installed two components that are not standard with Adapt.
* [adapt-iframe](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-iframe)
* [adapt-flipper-master] (https://github.com/danielstorey/adapt-flipper)

To do: I will install a component to allow navigation from the "table of contents" lists at top of lesson pages. 
(In the meantime, use progress bar in top-right corner to navigate between page sections.)
